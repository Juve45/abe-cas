Attribute Based Encryption for Compartmented  Access Structure

We provide implementation for an Attribute Based Encryption with Compartmented Access Structure
The implementation is written fully in C



 

# Encryption

The encryption algorithm encrypts an element from `mpz_t`.
It returns a tuple (for convenience a `struct Ciphertext_SSBM_ABE` was created), that contains the elements...


# KeyGeneration
The encryption algorithm encrypts an element from `mpz_t`.


# Decryption
The encryption algorithm encrypts an element from `mpz_t`.
